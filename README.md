paradise-edge-second
--------------------

is a "sandbox on an empty playground, late in the evening after all the kids went to sleep" 


apart from some mess it contains some awesome graphics by [EdgyZiane](https://www.facebook.com/EdgyZiane) which had the pleasure to go through custom made, half automated meat-grinder prepared by myself and which turned Edgy's raster images into interactive by nature vector shapes in an svg format.

the whole point was to try using different methods and hacks for integrating [svg specs](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) and the power that comes with it in game development setting.

here some ideas on gui for character creation workflow necessary for some games and most systems i know and which i would see myself making someday soon

it is a follow up to paradise-edge-payroll-1st-draft which integrated .svg format with some css hacks:
